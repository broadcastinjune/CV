    <h4>Work History</h4>
    <p>After a slew of corporate service jobs, I opened a vegetarian
        coffeeshop,
        <a href="http://bouldincreekcafe.com/"">Bouldin Creek Cafe,</a>
        with a friend in the Spring of 2000. I went from partner to manager, working 
        front of house, as well as line cooking. After I started doing office 
        work - basic bookkeeping - I decided in 2006 to go back to school to 
        get an accounting degree. Soon after I worked in the office full time, 
        and took over payroll.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of 2010, we moved the location to an old tire repair
        shop down the street, where we became a full-service restaurant.
        Since then, I have been the Office Administrator, doing all HR, 
        payroll, and full accounting for the business.
